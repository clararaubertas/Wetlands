The real Crystal City; well, is there such a thing? It&apos;s just something you read about in a children&apos;s book -- a real city couldn&apos;t cure and prevent illness in those who lived there, or keep its glass towers maintained with no one working on them. Even if there is something here, it&apos;s just an ordinary city -- nothing to justify your ever-increasing obsession. Nothing to justify coming so far from your home just to look for it.

Still, that&apos;s what you&apos;ve done so far.

First time players type HELP for more instructions.

Outside Waterworks
You are standing on a paved path leading uphill to the south and downhill to the north.

To the east is a broad brick building on which a lighted archway frames a closed door; a water fountain stands to one side in the archway. 

To the west you can see what looks like a pond, with a small structure rising from the water to the northwest, although a chain-link fence is blocking you from going right up to the pond. 

The ground dips a little on this side of the fence, exposing a large rusty pipe.

Muddy Beach
The pond laps gently up to the pile of brush and sticks accumulated here on the muddy shore. You can see some kind of structure rising out of the pond to the north -- it looks like a small boat-house or spring-house.

Behind you to the east you can climb the fence back to where you came from, and to the northeast the shoreline continues.

You can see a beer bottle (empty) here.

A small strip of shoreline, littered with small disclike rocks; sunlight strikes the rippling pond. You can see the structure to the west more clearly now -- it looks like a small boat-house or spring-house -- and it&apos;s probably close enough to wade. 

A wooden drawer is half-buried in the beach.

The shoreline continues to the southwest and to the northeast, and behind you to the south and east is a chain-link fence.

A gull swoops down and pecks at the drawer.

You are standing on a paved path leading uphill to the south and downhill to the north.

To the east is a broad brick building on which a lighted archway frames a closed door; a water fountain stands to one side in the archway.

To the west you can see what looks like a pond, with a small structure rising from the water to the northwest. A chain-link fence is blocking you from going up to the edge of the pond; the ground dips a little on this side of the fence, exposing a large rusty pipe.

Twisty stairs lead up to the northeast, and to the northwest is a grassy area. To the east and south are dense, gnarled pine trees.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Wetlands is an interactive quagmire, interactive fiction, or text adventure game. 

If you&apos;re new to the genre: Emily Short has written a great introduction to playing IF, available at http://inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/dm/IntroductionToIF.pdf. 

More specifically: try simple commands like GO NORTH, EXAMINE RIGHT POCKET, ASK SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING, INVENTORY, SLEEP, WAIT X MINUTES, PUSH SOMETHING, CLIMB SOMETHING, TURN SOMETHING ON, JUMP, SCORE, UNDO and more... 

There are not actually any time limits in this game. Nothing important will pass you by irrevocably, and it shouldn&apos;t be possible to get yourself really stuck (unless you do something obviously dumb like throw out stuff you&apos;ve found). There are fatal mistakes, but it should be clear when you&apos;re about to make them and you can always UNDO if necessary. Or SAVE your game to a file to return to your current situation later. 

Places you&apos;ve been, things you&apos;ve seen, and people  you&apos;ve talked to may change somewhat as your actions in-game affect them and their situations, so you should occasionally wander back to places you&apos;ve already been, and places that might have seemed like dead ends may open up as you change the state of the world. 

If you&apos;re stuck, try opening things, examining things, going in all the directions you can, thinking of unique ways objects can be used, revisiting old locations to see if your actions have changed them... and if all else fails, email the author for hints at clara.raubertas@gmail.com.

Pump Room
The basement of the Waterworks, concrete on every side, windowless, and waterstained; almost the entire room is taken up by a large device.

The spiral staircase leads back up to the main building.

The Secretary of Water leans down over the top of the staircase and looks at you.

The Secretary of Water peers at what you are doing. &quot;Could you please leave that thing to the technicians?&quot;

Inside Waterworks
A spacious interior, with bare brick walls supported by metal girders. To the west is the door back outside, and an unsteady-looking spiral staircase in a corner leads down.

A tall cylinder full of bubbling water stands in a corner.

The Secretary of Water is sitting at a simple metal desk, carefully sketching something in a notebook. A nameplate on the desk reads &quot;Secretary of Water, Pondside Waterworks&quot;.

Muddy Beach
The pond laps gently up to the pile of brush and sticks accumulated here on the muddy shore. You can see some kind of structure rising out of the pond to the north -- it looks like a small boat-house or spring-house.

Behind you to the east you can climb the fence back to where you came from, and to the northeast the shoreline continues.

You can see a beer bottle (empty) here.

A small strip of shoreline, littered with small disclike rocks; sunlight strikes the rippling pond. You can see the structure to the west more clearly now -- it looks like a small boat-house or spring-house -- and it&apos;s probably close enough to wade. 

A wooden drawer is half-buried in the beach.

    <result xml:space="preserve">&quot;Trains! Now there&apos;s something I know about!&quot; The conductor smiles, and gets a glazed look in his eye; in fact, now that he&apos;s on his favorite subject, he doesn&apos;t seem to be paying attention to anything you&apos;re doing.

&quot;Now this one we&apos;re riding is the PX1105; she has a rolling resistance of about 0.0005, which means she has to be pretty heavy to get enough traction. Almost three tons! Steam-powered, of course; there are those who say it&apos;s obsolete, but give me a taper boiler like this one any day.&quot;

&quot;This track here is narrow gauge; it&apos;s just Pondside local, so we don&apos;t join up with the national system or anything. Oh, and check out this rolling stock!&quot; He kicks the floor of the train with a pleased smile. &quot;Decades old and still solid as a rock. All steel!&quot;

&quot;This locomotive is a 2-6-2, you know. Originally designed to work with a tender, but we just refill the boiler every run since we have plenty of water around here! And we got a mechanical stoker, so I can take a break from that to come out here and talk the ears off of the passengers.&quot;

A foggy clearing in the woods that fades out into a small, dirty beach -- the railroad tracks pass through, entwined in purple viburnum vines, straight lines over the damp ground. 

To the east is the shore of the familiar pond, with a few stone steps leading into the misty water, and in every other direction, you can enter the dense woods. Water is trickling faintly onto the wet steps from underground.

A train is stopped on the tracks, puffing steam.

Woods
You are surrounded by colorful sweetgum and birch trees, and small rocks and boulders dot the ground underfoot, breaking up the monotony of the damp mat of red and brown leaves.

The trees cluster around you into a dense mesh. You could probably push your way through them in any direction, but they&apos;re so uniform that you can&apos;t visually distinguish which way leads anywhere except to more woods.

You can see a dog here.

The dog chases its own tail.

Small Clearing
You are in a small opening in the otherwise almost impassably dense forest; someone appears to have chopped down a few trees to create some space directly around a particular large boulder -- the space is partially filled with a small cinderblock hut. 

The opening gets larger to the southwest, and in every other direction, you see only the dense woods.
